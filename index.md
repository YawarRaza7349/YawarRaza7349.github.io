## About

I am seeking an entry-level software developer position, preferably non-remote, almost anywhere in the United States. I have B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from Rochester Institute of Technology, as well as a year of internship experience doing software development.

I have learned about and used many technologies in a variety of contexts, and can thus adapt to different tech stacks and platforms. That said, I am most comfortable doing backend application development, spanning both the business domain layer and the database layer. I prefer to develop in Java, C#, or similar (i.e. statically-typed and garbage-collected) languages. My database experience is in SQL, and I have used several implementations throughout my work. My ability to navigate and understand large codebases written by others allows me to quickly start updating and adding features to applications, as well as maintain and refactor legacy code. I especially enjoy going through existing bug reports, finding and fixing the code causing each bug. Additionally, I'd be interested in creating self-contained software tools for internal use by both developers and non-developers.

I am familiar with various styles of computer programming, as well as the trade-offs they have in comparison to each other. I took a course on functional programming early in my degree, and kept learning more about Haskell and static types for a few years after, before switching my focus to programming language theory and reading research papers on type systems and related topics. Meanwhile, I also obtained experience creating visually-rich, interactive visualizations and games through my double-major in Game Design and Development, using APIs at varying levels of abstraction, such as shape-drawing libraries and scene graph frameworks. Furthermore, I took two Software Engineering electives, one about object-oriented design patterns and one about the Alloy and SPIN formal methods tools, a background I look forward to extending to enterprise architectures, concurrent and distributed applications, and other forms of software.

I also like explaining computer programming concepts to others, both through one-on-one conversations and through written explanations. This ranges from teaching well-known content to presenting ideas that I think of myself. Given all this, I am also open to positions such as technical writer or instructor, as well as positions involving studying and documenting computing systems, such as large codebases. Samples of my technical writing can be found in the "Projects" section below.

The RIT course I took about design patterns also had a unit on refactoring, another important part of making your code clearly organized. I'm reminded of a Code Review Stack Exchange answer I wrote years ago, [[linked here]](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/161948). While this question was asked by a novice, professional codebases can also see similar redundancy arise as code evolves over time. Such code can be confusing to read, and is best carefully assessed and refactored to remove the residual parts. Have you ever seen code like this, leftover after many changes, in the codebases you've worked in? What did you do about it and how did it turn out?

Back when I was in college, I remember seeing the "Object" documentation page for the Reason programming language and thinking it could use some improvement. I had planned to draft a full rewrite of the page to show the Reason team, but never ended up getting to it.

Recently, I thought to check if anyone else had fixed up the page, only to find it the same as it was almost a decade earlier. Rather than contemplate the broad overhaul I'd imagined, I decided to just submit a pull request addressing the biggest issue on the page, which you can check out in [[this link]](https://github.com/reasonml/reasonml.github.io/pull/768).

It goes to show that even if you think someone else will surely get to that thing you noticed, sometimes they won't, and it's best to point it out yourself and work on whatever you can, even if it's not much. Have you ever taken the initiative to address an overlooked problem? How did you approach the situation and what did you learn from it?

### Post

It's exciting having a prominent computer scientist giving "thumbs-up" to several of your comments to his blog posts. While a lot of the blog covers topics that are newer to me, there were places where my background allowed me to add to some of the points he made. You can read all the comments I posted on his blog through [[this link]](https://github.com/search?q=commenter%3AYawarRaza7349%20repo%3Alawrencecpaulson%2Flawrencecpaulson.github.io&type=issues).

In some of the comments, I expressed disagreement with certain ideas he presented in his posts. Have you ever found yourself disagreeing with an expert in your craft? Did either of you end up changing your mind in the long run?

[[Original post]](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7194053165376237570/)

It's worth considering that leaders should be familiar with their employees' responsibilities in a different way than the employee themself is. It's less useful to learn how for-loops work than it is to, for example, observe how developers use their tools and processes at a high-level, something that the developer might not have consciously analyzed about themself. This knowledge is then used to help coordinate everyone with each other. The point of a leader as a distinct role is to take on a different responsibility than the other members of the team, which entails a different perspective.
