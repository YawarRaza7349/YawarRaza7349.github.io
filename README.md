Please visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/YawarRaza7349) for more information about me, including other projects I've contributed to. This page is a supplement that highlights smaller, visually-engaging and/or interactive applications I've written, some with live demos.

## Projects
Here are some projects I've worked on, including both open projects for class assignments and out-of-class projects. Each project is linked to a GitHub repository, so you can see the full source code for each project. The web-based projects also have links to runnable programs, so you can try them out instantly.

#### [Math Fusion](https://github.com/bro9918/24Game)
A game made for the Educational Games class I took. I was part of a team of four; I was the primary developer for the user interface system to navigate among the different game screens. The gameplay is like the 24 Game, with the player playing as a chef, mixing ingredients, each associated with a number, using utensils, each associated with an operation. The goal is to make 24, and once the player does so, they are shown the nutrition information about the meal they just cooked.

#### [Frame-by-Frame Animation Application](https://github.com/YawarRaza7349/FrameByFrameAnimationApplication)
This is a application that allows the user to create simple frame-by-frame animations with features like a paint bucket tool and onion skinning.

#### [Processing Typing Game](https://github.com/YawarRaza7349/ProcessingTypingGame)
This is a simple typing game, geared towards typing programs, even simulating simple code editor features.

#### [Shape Periodic Waves](https://github.com/YawarRaza7349/ShapePeriodicWaves)
An application that shows [these](http://i.imgur.com/DWuA6Vn.gif) polar graphs on an arbitrary shape the programmer defines.

#### [Cyclic Cicadas](https://github.com/YawarRaza7349/CyclicCicadas)
Shows an animated graph of the United States showing extrapolated cicada populations in each state based on prior data.

#### [Greebles](https://github.com/YawarRaza7349/Greebles) [*(try me)*](https://jsfiddle.net/zycgwb0p/embedded/result/)
A screen of randomly placed, animated UI widgets, reminiscent of futuristic sci-fi movies and TV shows.

#### [Yu-Gi-Oh! Card Stat Correlations](https://github.com/YawarRaza7349/YuGiOhCardStatCorrelations) [*(try me)*](https://jsfiddle.net/n5w1av7z/embedded/result/)
A grid based off the stats of Yu-Gi-Oh! Monster cards, which also includes filtering and links to more info about each card.

#### [Popular Languages of GitHub vs. StackOverflow](https://github.com/YawarRaza7349/PopularLanguagesOfGitHubVsStackOverflow) [*(try me)*](http://people.rit.edu/ysr7349/330/p2/graph.html)
Plots various popular programming languages on a 2D graph based on their popularity on GitHub and StackOverflow.

#### [2048Game.hs](https://github.com/YawarRaza7349/2048Game.hs)
A command-line version of the popular 2048 game written in Haskell, a functional programming language.
